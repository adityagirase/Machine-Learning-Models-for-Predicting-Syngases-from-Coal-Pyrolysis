# Pyrolysis Data Analysis

Pyrolysis is a thermochemical conversion process used for the production of biofuels such as biochar, bio-oil, and syngas. The quality and yield of products obtained during coal pyrolysis are dependent on several factors, such as coal composition (proximate and ultimate analysis) and reaction conditions (temperature, heating rate, time). Therefore, it is imperative to understand the relationship between biomass composition, reaction conditions, and product yield during coal pyrolysis.

## Project Overview

This project employs a data-driven machine learning (ML) and interpretability approach to study the complex relationships between coal composition, reaction conditions, and product yield in the context of pyrolysis. Additionally, we aim to make the findings interpretable, as many ML models are often regarded as black boxes.

## Key Findings

- Several machine learning models were compared to assess their performance in this context.
- The performance of XGBoost models improved substantially after hyperparameter optimization.
