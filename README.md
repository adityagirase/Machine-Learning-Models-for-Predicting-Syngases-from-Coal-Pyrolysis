# Pyrolysis Data Analysis

Pyrolysis is a thermochemical conversion process used for the production of biofuels such as biochar, bio-oil, and syngas. The quality and yield of products obtained during coal pyrolysis are dependent on several factors, such as coal composition (proximate and ultimate analysis) and reaction conditions (temperature, heating rate, time). Therefore, it is imperative to understand the relationship between biomass composition, reaction conditions, and product yield during coal pyrolysis.

## Project Overview

This project introduces a novel approach by integrating Machine Learning models to ac
curately predict the product distribution of coal pyrolysis, including syngas, char, and
pyrolysis oil yields. Additionally, a userfriendly graphical interface has been designed to facilitate easy input of process parameters and enable rapid predictions, making the tool accessible to researchers and industry professionals.

## Key Findings

- Several machine learning models were compared to assess their performance in this context.
- The performance of XGBoost models improved substantially after hyperparameter optimization.
