# Pyrolysis Data Analysis

Pyrolysis is a thermochemical conversion process used for the production of biofuels such as biochar, bio-oil, and syngas. The quality and yield of products obtained during coal pyrolysis are dependent on several factors, such as coal composition (proximate and ultimate analysis) and reaction conditions (temperature, heating rate, time). Therefore, it is imperative to understand the relationship between coal composition, reaction conditions, and product yield during coal pyrolysis.

## Project Overview

This project introduces a novel approach by integrating Machine Learning models to accurately predict the product distribution of coal pyrolysis, including syngas, char, and pyrolysis oil yields. Additionally, a userfriendly graphical interface has been designed to facilitate easy input of process parameters and enable rapid predictions, making the tool accessible to researchers and industry professionals.

## Objectives
- To develop a Machine Learning model to predict the product distribution of pyrolysis yields obtained from coal pyrolysis.
- To develop a Machine Learning model to predict methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2) gas yields from coal pyrolysis.
- To create a graphical user interface for future predictions.
- To understand the effect of various operating conditions on hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) production.

## Key Findings

- Several machine learning models were compared to assess their performance in this context.
- The performance of XGBoost models improved substantially after hyperparameter optimization.
